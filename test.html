Thanks to the Montalcino region's long growing season, its Brunellos are luxurious and age-worthy, like this one with flavours of blackberry, raspberry and earth. Decant for two hours and serve with rare steaks or roast leg of lamb, or cellar for up to 10 years.

Stags' Leap Winery is more than a deer crossing. Layered and complex, this wine features aromas and flavours of cassis, black cherry, cinnamon and woodsmoke. This pleasurable powerhouse is cellarable for up to 5 years, but it can also give a dinner featuring rare steaks, roast beef or lamb an extra bounce.

A champion of Napa Merlot, Sterling launched California's first-ever vintage dated bottle in 1969. Now legendary, this silky, succulent wine is bursting with blackberry and cherry flavours. Serve this beauty up with beef empanadas, roast chicken or veal cutlets.

Penfolds is a cornerstone of the Australian wine scene. They've packed this bold beauty with ripe black cherries, plum, chocolate, and hints of smoke and oak. Pair with stuffed veal tenderloin, roasted vegetables, or grilled portobello mushrooms.

With tropical notes of pineapple and banana plus buttercream, caramel and smoke, this is a smooth, creamy Chardonnay. Bonterra's organic practices help express the vibrancy of the fruit. Pair with grilled shrimp, chicken tourtière or lobster with butter sauce.

In Spain, Reserva wines must be matured for three years in cask and bottle before release. This is an easygoing wine with aromas of cherry and spring flowers. It sizzles with hamburgers, beef empanadas or roast chicken stuffed with olives, almonds and paprika.
